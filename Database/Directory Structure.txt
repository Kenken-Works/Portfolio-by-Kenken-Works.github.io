精神障害者保健福祉手帳の申請をプログラミングソースコードに変換したメモ。

 To organize the current code into a more structured directory tree with clearly defined roles and responsibilities for each class or module, we'll break down the provided functionality into four directories, each representing a specific aspect of the application process. Here's a plan on how to split the existing code and additional functionalities into these directories:

### Directory Structure
```
Techou_Shinsei/
├── BasicFunctionsAndSetup/
│   └── submissionChecks.js
├── ApplicationReviewProcess/
│   └── applicationProcessor.js
├── ApplicationEvaluationAndProcessing/
│   └── evaluationModule.js
└── TextBasedDatabase/
    └── legalReferences.js
```

### Descriptions and Responsibilities for Each Directory:

1. **BasicFunctionsAndSetup** (基本機能と設定)
   - **File:** `submissionChecks.js`
   - **Description:** This module will contain functions that check basic conditions of the application, such as whether it has been officially submitted.
   - **Functionality:** 
     ```javascript
     function isSubmitted(application) {
         return application.isSubmitted;
     }
     ```

2. **ApplicationReviewProcess** (申請のReview process)
   - **File:** `applicationProcessor.js`
   - **Description:** This class/module will handle the initialization and starting point of the application processing.
   - **Functionality:** 
     ```javascript
     class ApplicationProcessor {
         constructor(application) {
             this.application = application;
         }

         process() {
             console.log("Processing application...");
             return this.evaluate();
         }

         // Additional methods to handle different stages of processing
     }
     ```

3. **ApplicationEvaluationAndProcessing** (申請の評価と処理)
   - **File:** `evaluationModule.js`
   - **Description:** This module focuses on evaluating the application against specific criteria, such as legal compliance and meeting the required conditions.
   - **Functionality:** 
     ```javascript
     function evaluateApplication(application) {
         if (!isSubmitted(application)) {
             console.log("Application has not been officially submitted.");
             return false;
         }
         if (!meetsLegalCriteria(application)) {
             console.log("Application does not meet legal criteria.");
             return false;
         }
         console.log("Application meets all criteria. Proceeding with approval.");
         return true;
     }
     ```

4. **TextBasedDatabase** (テキストベースのデータベース)
   - **File:** `legalReferences.js`
   - **Description:** This directory will contain references to laws, regulations, and case law that are relevant to the application's context.
   - **Functionality:** 
     ```javascript
     // Example function to fetch legal standards and criteria
     function fetchLegalStandards() {
         // Retrieve and return legal standards and criteria from stored data
     }
     ```

### Implementation Plan:
- **Step 1:** Create the directory structure as outlined above.
- **Step 2:** Distribute the existing functions and class implementations into the respective files and directories based on their functionalities.
- **Step 3:** Implement any missing functionality, such as detailed legal checks in `legalReferences.js`, which might involve interfacing with a database or static files containing legal data.
- **Step 4:** Ensure all modules are interconnected where necessary, such as importing the submission checks into the evaluation module for comprehensive processing.
- **Step 5:** Test each module independently and then as a complete system to ensure the entire application review process functions as expected.

By organizing the code in this manner, each part of the application process is clearly delineated, making the system easier to manage, update, and scale.
